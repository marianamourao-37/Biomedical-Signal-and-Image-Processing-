# Biomedical-Signal-and-Image-Processing

In this repository, the projects developed for the **Biomedical Signal and Image Processing** academic course are made available. 

### Signal Processing Labs
- **Lab 3:** Autocorrelation and Correlation in Time-Series Signals
- **Lab 4:** Convolution and Signal Detrending
- **Lab 5:** Fourier Transform and Window Functions
- **Lab 6:** Digital Filtering
- **Lab 7:** Time-Frequency Analysis using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)

### Image Processing Labs
- **Lab 8:** Image Representation and Basic Processing
- **Lab 9:** 2D Fourier Transform and Spatial Filtering
- **Lab 10:** Edge Detection and Image Segmentation
- **Lab 11:** Morphological Operations and Image Transformations

I was evaluated with written reports for Lab 3 and Lab 10, where I achieved a score of **19/20** in both cases. These reports are made available.
